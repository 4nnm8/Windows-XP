If you're interested, your help is very welcome :)

Sorry I'm french so the interface is writen this way (but the code is in english)

The code is actually a mess so I try to organize and clean it so people car participate more easily

Rule #1 : if you can do it with CSS, do it with CSS ! less images as possible

Rule #2 : vanilla javascript only


TO DO LIST :

* Check if the URL to a program exists before opening it
* Avoid inline png files (data:image/png;base64...) and make CSS sprites for each icon size (16,24,32,48)
* Allow to drag multiple icons at one time
* Maybe don't use IFRAME but Web Components for Programs
* Add context menu to programs in taskbar (close, minimize, maximize)
* Make a file explorer
* Add proper sounds to all actions
* Add proper fonts
* Prevent resizing windows too small (AND FIX THAT BUG WITH WINDOWS RESIZING DIRECTION)
* When copying a file or a folder, add a number to avoid same name ("Image.jpg" > "Image (1).jpg", etc)
* Merge all mousemove events because we need them often
* Be able to create a new file or new folder with context menu (and being able to open that new folder or file)
* Link filetype to programs so we can open files with programs (won't be easy with cross-origin programs)
* Make a save state of the desktop (HARD)

* WHATEVER you want to do !
