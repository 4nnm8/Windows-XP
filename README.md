If you're interested, your help is very welcome :)

Sorry I'm french so the interface is writen this way (but the code is in english)

The code is actually a mess so I try to organize and clean it so people car participate more easily

Rule #1 : if you can do it with CSS, do it with CSS ! less images as possible

Rule #2 : vanilla javascript only, except for programs if you want

TO DO LIST :

* Check if the URL to a program exists before opening it
* Allow to drag multiple icons at one time
* Add context menu to programs in taskbar (close, minimize, maximize)
* Make a file explorer (with a filesystem tree in json)
* Add proper sounds to all actions
* Add proper fonts
* When copying a file or a folder, add a number to avoid same name ("Image.jpg" > "Image (1).jpg", etc)
* Be able to create a new file or new folder with context menu (and being able to open that new folder or file)
* Link filetype to programs so we can open files with programs (won't be easy with cross-origin programs)
* Correct scrollbar bug
* Improve quicklaunch slider
* Inline PNG to 16, 32, 48px sprites
* Make the Date & Time window
* Allow drag and drop from/to Desktop, Start Menu, Windows (through iframes), etc.
* Handle delete files memory
* Fix the Windows Size according to its content
* Clean the code
* WHATEVER you want to do !
