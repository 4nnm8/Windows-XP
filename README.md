TO DO LIST :

* Check if the URL to a program exists before opening it
* Allow to drag multiple icons at one time
* Create context popup to confirm / cancell actions (like deleting a file)
* Allow copy/paste drag 'n drop files from a folder to another (like the trash for start)

* Maybe don't use IFRAME but Web Components for Programs
* Add context menu to programs in taskbar
* Allow all the actions on icons (select with cursor, copy, paste, rename) on other workspaces that desktop
* Add proper sounds to all actions
* Prevent resizing windows too small
* When copying a file or a folder, add a number to avoid same name ("Image.jpg" > "Image (1).jpg", etc)
* Merge all mousemove events because we need them often
* Be able to create a new file or new folder with context menu
* Link filetype to programs so we can open files with programs (won't be easy with cross-origin programs)
* Clean that mess of a code
